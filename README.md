# DSS Project
## Data Cleaning
- [ ] Check for duplicates
- [ ] Check for missing values
- [ ] Check for the datatype format
- [ ] Check inconsistencies

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] Plot the data (univariate/bivariate/multi-variables)
- [ ] Check for relationships (correlation plot)
    - Make your story here

## Preprocessing
- [ ] Make sure to scale data columns so they contribute equally for machine learning
- [ ] label encode (for binary or classification with order)/ one hot encode (for classification without order like colors)
- [ ] choose your target variable to predict (in this case Final Grade)
- [ ] Split the entire data to 70:30 ratio 
    - train the data on 70 and validate on the remaining 30%

## Generate report 
- Make the jupyter notebook as the documentation itself. (use markdown for documentation)
- Create pdf documentation for the project. This is free format as long as this is formal and contains the findings of your project)
